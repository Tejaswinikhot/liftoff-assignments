## Submission Instructions

### Overview
    This Project called 'Organic Based Nutrition Recipes' . Organic Ingredient Recipes is the web application that will allow end user to find the organic produce and their corresponding recipes. This app is useful for who is looking for Healthy diet in daily lifestyle . In this we allow user to select some organic produce, list the nutritional facts and then allow to seach recipes based on selected organic produce. In current world, health is most important  and many people would want to move towards  keeping healthy. This is just the prototype currently  with minimul features like login/registration , search organic future. I would like to expand this and list all the available brand that produce organic products  and list them. that way this site would also be used to find products and which brand offer organic etc. 
    So this idea come up in my mind, my Father and family doing Organic farming since 1998, and introducing lots of Indian organic products like Grains, Rice,Beans, Turmeric ,Onions ,Galic,Jaggery etc. People doesnâ€™t know importance of Organic based food in daily need and their nutrition value. So I am trying to introduce Healthy way to eat Organic foods through the Recipes .
